Welcome to BAMAZON Marketplace

For Customers:
As a customer you may choose products from a list of available items for sale.  Each item has an Item ID, Name and Price.  Customers begin by entering the Item ID of the product they would like to buy. They are then prompted to enter the quantity.  If there is insufficient stock they receive an error message. If there is sufficient quantity they are given their order total.

For Managers:
Managers have the option to view products for sale, view low inventory, add new products. Choosing to view low inventory only shows items that have 5 or less items in stock. When adding new products, the manager begins by entering the name of the product followed by the department, price and quantity.
